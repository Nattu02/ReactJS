# React hooks

 These are normal JS utility functions written by Facebook developers. 
 Two most important hooks. 
 - useState() - used to create superpowerful react variables
 - useEffect()

 React hooks should be imported as named imports 
 import {useEffect} from "react";

State varaibles can be created as => const [Name, setName -> function to modify the variables ] = useState([Value for the variable])
